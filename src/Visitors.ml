   (except by passing it on to its callees). Thus, the method cannot be
   overridden by a custom implementation that actually uses the environment.

   2. One might wish for the environment to have monomorphic type. In that
   case, one should note that there is a priori no reason why the type of
   the environment should be the same in every method. So, we must be
   careful not to use a single type variable ['env]. We must use a distinct
   type variable every time, or (easier but equivalent) use a wildcard.

   How do we let the user specify which behavior is desired? And with what
   granularity? We choose a simple approach: we treat ['env] as polymorphic
   if and only if this (reserved) type variable is declared polymorphic by

   issue a wildcard [_] and let OCaml infer this type.

   Yet, if the user has requested that every method be polymorphic in
   the type ['env] of the environment, then [visit_'a], too must be
   polymorphic in ['env]. (Otherwise, the generated code would be ill-typed.)
   In that case, we must generate ['env . 'env -> _].

   This implies that [visit_'a] cannot use the environment.
   So, it seems somewhat doubtful that this feature is useful.
   Perhaps we could allow the environment to consist of two components
   and to quantify universally over only one of them? *)
