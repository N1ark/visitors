Should we eliminate all quotations and remove our dependency on ppx_tools?
  (or at least the syntax extension provided by ppx_tools)

Document that we are creating hooks for data constructors.

Move all of the naming conventions that could clash to a single place.

Deal with parameterized type definitions.
  Both local and nonlocal.
  Requires polymorphic methods.

Generate iter, fold, map, iter2, fold2, map2.

Think about compositionality.
  By multiple inheritance?

Think about transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.

Inline records cannot be supported in a satisfactory way,
  since there is no way of writing an auxiliary method
  whose argument is known to have a certain tag.

There could be a clash between the name of a type and the name of a data
  constructor, leading to the generation of two methods by the same name.
