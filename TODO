TODO (REALLY)

Avoid generating beta-redexes.
  (fun (x, y) -> ...) z should be let (x, y) = z in ...

Test on the Frama-C AST.
  Instantiate visit_'term and visit_'locs and make sure we have working code.

Develop support for names and binders.
  Try to make it a functor, i.e., independent of the structure of terms.
  Do we need private methods?

Try the system with hash-consed terms. (With/without binding.)
Try dealing with an open term definition and closing it afterwards.
Try dealing with suspended substitutions.
  (As a distinct construct. Not necessarily at abstractions.)

Document everything.
  The name [VisitorsRuntime] must not be shadowed.

TODO (PERHAPS)

Generate a "fold" class in addition to iter and map?
  Should not be difficult.
  Create virtual methods for local types. Use external functions for nonlocal types.
  Analogous to ppx_tools/genlifter.

Do something about ~path?
  It seems connected to nested modules.

Think about automatically transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.
