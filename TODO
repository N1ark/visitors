TODO

Document everything.

Modify ClassFieldStore.generate to avoid producing multiple declarations
of a virtual method.

Avoid warnings about unused variables.

Maybe iter and map should not inherit from visitor;
  the user could mix them by herself;
  or iter and map could be defined directly (for speed).

Maybe use our own exception, instead of Failure.
  Also, should ensure that the names "raise" and "Failure" cannot be captured.
  Requires a runtime library.

Deal with abstract types just as if they were nonlocal.

Optionally deal with builtin types.
  Requires a runtime library.

Think about compositionality.
  By multiple inheritance?

Think about transforming a closed recursive type definition into an open one.

BUGS

The tuple trick of always reconstructing a tuple may not work as desired?
It may force the user to also reconstruct a tuple when implementing his own
folds. Investigate.

If A.t and B.t are nonlocal types, then (with our current naming convention)
we have a name clash.
