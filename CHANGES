A new option [polymorphic = true] allows generating visitor methods with
polymorphic types. With [polymorphic = true], a type variable ['a] is
handled by a visitor *function* [visit_'a], which is passed as an argument
to every visitor method; whereas, with [polymorphic = false], a type
variable ['a] is handled by a virtual visitor *method* [visit_'a].
When [polymorphic] is [true], irregular algebraic data types are supported.
See the documentation for more details.

2017/03/03:
A new option [data = false] allows suppressing the generation of visitor
methods for data constructors. This makes the generated visitor slightly
simpler and faster, but less customizable.

A new option [nude = true] allows *not* implicitly inheriting the class
VisitorsRuntime.<variety>.

Makefile.preprocess is now installed with the package, so users can rely on it
without needing to copy it. See the documentation for instructions.

2017/02/13:
Added a new variety of visitors, "mapreduce". This visitor computes a pair of a
data structure (like a "map" visitor) and a summary (like a "reduce" visitor).
This can be used to annotate every tree node with information about the
subtree that lies below it. See the documentation for an example.

2017/02/09:
Documentation: added a new subsection on OCaml objects,
entitled "Where the expressiveness of OCaml's type system falls short".
This section explains why "map" cannot be a subclass of "fold",
even though it should be.

2017/01/31:
Documentation: added an example of constructing a lexicographic ordering.
Documentation: discussed generating visitors for existing types and ppx_import.

2017/01/26:
Initial release.
