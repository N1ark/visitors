A new option [data = false] allows suppressing the generation of visitor
methods for data constructors. This makes the generated visitor slightly
simpler and faster, but less customizable.

2017/02/15:
Makefile.preprocess is now installed with the package, so users can rely on it
without needing to copy it.

2017/02/13:
Added a new variety of visitors, "mapreduce". This visitor computes a pair of a
data structure (like a "map" visitor) and a summary (like a "reduce" visitor).
This can be used to annotate every tree node with information about the
subtree that lies below it. See the documentation for an example.

2017/02/09:
Documentation: added a new subsection on OCaml objects,
entitled "Where the expressiveness of OCaml's type system falls short".
This section explains why "map" cannot be a subclass of "fold",
even though it should be.

2017/01/31:
Documentation: added an example of constructing a lexicographic ordering.
Documentation: discussed generating visitors for existing types and ppx_import.

2017/01/26:
Initial release.
