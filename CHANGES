2017/02/13:
Add a new variety of visitors, "mapreduce".

2017/02/09:
Documentation: a new subsection on OCaml objects,
entitled "Where the expressiveness of OCaml's type system falls short".
This section explains why "map" cannot be a subclass of "fold",
even though it should be.

2017/02/07:
VisitorsRuntime: make every method monomorphic in 'env.
In theory, this should be more flexible, as it allows overriding these methods
with code that actually uses the environment. In practice, I don't have a
compelling example where that would be necessary or useful.

2017/01/31:
Documentation: added an example of constructing a lexicographic ordering.
Documentation: discussed generating visitors for existing types and ppx_import.

2017/01/26:
Initial release.
