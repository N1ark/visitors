(* This kit serves to construct a [subst] function for terms -- a function
   that substitutes things (possibly terms) for atoms. *)

(* An environment is a map [sigma] of atoms to things. We require every binder
   [x] encountered along the way to be fresh with respect to [sigma]. *)

     perform the domain check. The codomain check cannot be performed
     since the type of things is abstract here. *)
  assert (not (Atom.Map.mem x sigma));
  (* Since [x] is fresh for [sigma], no capture is possible. Thus, no
     freshening of the bound name is required. Thus, we can keep the
     substitution [sigma], unchanged, under the binder. *)

   instead? should [KitSubstAtom] be a special case of [KiSubst]? *)
