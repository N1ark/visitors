capture-avoiding substitution with freshening (nominal w/o GUH)
substitution of terms for variables (must copy term when grafting)
linear substitution of term for variable (w/o copying; check linearity at runtime?)
alpha-equivalence test (nominal)
test x \in fv(t) (nominal)
entering a binder (and testing for global uniqueness)
simultaneous opening? (nominal)
efficient printing (conversion from nominal back to raw) with pre-computation of fa
well-formedness checking (just traversing the term and checking for global uniqueness)
-- test for global uniqueness everywhere an environment is extended
