Operations on terms:
  test x \in fv(t) (nominal)
  simultaneous opening? (nominal)
  efficient printing (conversion from nominal back to raw) with pre-computation of fa
  well-formedness checking (just traversing the term and checking for global uniqueness)
  -- test for global uniqueness everywhere an environment is extended

Operations on each kind of environment:
  Entering a binder (and testing for global uniqueness).

Add printers for Atom.Map, Atom.Subst,
and possibly the various kinds of environments that we use.

Document the precondition and postcondition of every function
  in terms of ownership of atoms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO (POSSIBLY):

Operations in nominal style, without the GUH.
  Capture-avoiding substitution with freshening of bound names.
