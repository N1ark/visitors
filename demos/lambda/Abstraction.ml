type void

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* A universal type of single-name abstractions. *)

(* We wish to represent all kinds of abstractions -- e.g. in nominal style,
   in de Bruijn style, etc. -- so we parameterize the abstraction over the
   type ['bn] of the bound name and over the type ['term] of the body. This
   makes this type definition almost trivial -- it is just a pair -- but it
   still serves as a syntactic marker of where abstractions are located. *)

type ('bn, 'term) abstraction =
  'bn * 'term

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* The main effect of an abstraction is to cause the environment to be enriched
   when the abstraction is traversed. As different kinds of traversals maintain
   different types of environments, we offer a variety of functions that enrich
   an environment. These functions are ready for use in a visitor. *)

(* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* The functions associated with the type variable ['bn] are never invoked. *)
(* TEMPORARY explain why *)

   atoms. *)

   right away, that is, we map each binding occurrence to a fresh atom. *)
